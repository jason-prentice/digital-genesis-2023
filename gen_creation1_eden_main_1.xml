                ['elohim] implies rulership, and has plural grammatical form... [However,] Since the

                (Kimhi, qtd. in Carasik 3) Editors' Comment: Although most English-language
                translations render this word as "God," we have chosen to transliterate it as
                "Elohim." Our reason is that most (or even all) readers come to the text with
                preconceptions about who or what God is. Our use of "Elohim" is meant to free our
                readers from this anachronistic frame of reference and to encourage them to view
                this character Elohim in a fresh light. It should also be noted that not all
                scholars agree with Kimhi's statement that, despite the plural form of Elohim, there

                before God begins, there is already a chaotic mixture of material at hand, including
                water, darkness, and apparently land. Also, some of the things Elohim creates are
                bound up in division/separation: the purpose of the firmament is to separate the
                waters, and after light is made, it still must be divided from darkness.
                Division/separation, it seems, is a principle of Elohim's creation/world.</note>

                once again in the Bible... Is any man able to tell exactly what God wanted the earth

                though even the earth did not have a much clearer idea than we do, for it did not
                grass grass but sent forth grass... A general pattern is established here which
                develops throughout the entire book. God begins by requiring the highest, but is
                satisfied with the highest possible. The book, from a certain point of view, may be

            <note target="#a016">Comment: First-person plural here (and in Genesis 3:22) may be a
                holdover from polytheistic roots of ancient Hebrew culture. "[T]he royal 'we' used
                by many European monarchs in self-reference [. . .] is not to be found in the
                ancient world." (Good 43-44) Editors' Comment: Within Roman Catholic tradition,
                instances of first-person plural such as this have been interpreted as evidence of
                the underlying trinitarian nature of God. However, that is an anachronistic,
                ahistorical interpretation that is not rooted in the text.</note>

                Alt. Trans: "the human being" (Kass) Alt. Trans: "humankind" (NRSV) Comment: "Though
                the noun is male in gender... its meaning is sex neutral..." (Kass says 36) Editors'
                Comment: In accordance with leading contemporary translations, we have replaced to
                OJPS's In virtually all places where 'adam is used in the original Hebrew, we have
                translated that word as more literally and accurately as "human being," which does
                not denote a person of the male sex. The only places where we have translated 'adam
                differently are the places where it seems to be used as the personal name of the
                first man, in which case we have translated it as Adam. Unlike 'adam, the Hebrew
                word 'ish denotes a person who is male. Accordingly, we have translated 'ish as man.
                Thus, the reader can tell when 'adam or 'ish is used by the base text. Editors'
                Comment: The human being is the second of Elohim's creations that is not observed to
                be good.</note>

                human beings are created "after our [Elohim's] likeness." This variation on a

                Although in Christianity the serpent is often understood to be Satan or the Devil,
                there is no mention of Satan or the Devil in Genesis, and no mention in the Tanakh
                (Hebrew Bible) until Zechariah 3:1 (in Christian Bible, 1 Chronicles). (Kass 81)
                Comment: "The documents and pictures of the peoples of the ancient East do not
                assist us to solve the problem of the serpent in our section. We find there all
                kinds of snakes: sacred serpents, serpent-gods or serpents that symbolize the
                deities, serpents that are symbols of life or fertility, serpents that guard the
                sanctuaries or the boundaries, serpents used for 'divining' future events, and so
                forth; but so far no serpents have been found corresponding in character to the one
                in this section." (Cassuto 140) Editors' Comment: The serpent is one of just two
                talking animals in all of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). The other is Balaam's ass in
                Numbers 22. </note>
            <note target="#a026">Heb.: 'arum = cunning/crafty/subtle/shrewd (Kass 80) Comment: The
                Hebrew word 'arum sounds similar to the Hebrew word 'arumin, which means "naked" and
                has a root sense of "smooth." In this way, the subtlety/knowingness of the serpent
                is linked with the nakedness of the man and woman later in the story. (Kass
                82)</note>
            <note target="#a027">Comment: Strangely, although the serpent and the woman speak about
                "Elohim," the narration refers only to "Yahweh Elohim." (Good 37)</note>

                Five Books) Comment: "There is a long tradition of rendering the first term here [.
                . .] as 'delight' or something similar. But ta'awah means 'that which is intensely
                desired,' 'appetite,' and sometimes specifically 'lust.'" (Alter, Five Books 24-25)
                Editors' Comment: Although some scholars, such as Kass, reject the idea that there
                is a sexual component to the events of the Eden story, Alter's comments on this
                ancient Hebrew word, the theme of nakedness, the very nature of fruit as a
                reproductive organ, and the ambiguous meaning of the ancient Hebrew word for "know"
                (which can have an intellectual sense or a sexual sense), together suggest that
                there may in fact be a sexual theme.</note>

                OJPS translation is in line with most contemporary translations, such as the NJPS
                and NRSV, Alter supports his translation by arguing there is an internal parallelism
                to the verse ("lust to the eyes... lovely to look at"), by pointing to the kinship
                between seeing and knowing in ancient Hebrew (and many other languages), and by
                observing that some of the very first translations of the Hebrew Bible (the Aramaic

                learn the meaning of his actions. God asks four simple questions, less to obtain
                information, more to induce a searching of the soul" (Kass 92).</note>
            <note target="#a031">Heb.: hishi'ani = lifted me (Kass 93) Editors' Comment: Although
                many contemporary readers approach the text already knowing that the Eden story is
                about "The Fall of Man," the "Fall" is a Christian concept that is never referenced
                in the text. In this passage, the literal meaning of the woman's words, and perhaps
                the positive connotation frequently attached to the notion of moving upward, should
                lead the reader to consider whether eating the fruit is a purely negative
                action.</note>
