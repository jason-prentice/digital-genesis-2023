Need to add titles for all other sections.

Need to add source encoding for everyhting except flood.

Created new div attribute values: @type="story." This may replace @type="chiasm" in the Flood encoding.
@type="intro"/"expo" (I need to ask the students about whether we can use a common term for all of the stories we've encoded.)
@type="body"
@type="conc"/"resolution" (I need to ask the students about whether we can use a common term for all of the stories we've encoded.)

                    meant to free our readers from this anachronistic frame of reference and to
                    encourage them to view this character Elohim in a fresh light. It should also be

                    at hand, including water, darkness, and apparently land. Also, some of the
                    things Elohim creates are bound up in division/separation: the purpose of the
                    firmament is to separate the waters, and after light is made, it still must be
                    divided from darkness. Division/separation, it seems, is a principle of Elohim's

                    translated it as Adam. Unlike 'adam, the Hebrew word 'ish denotes a person who
                    is male. Accordingly, we have translated 'ish as man. Thus, the reader can tell

                <note target="#a043">Editors' Comment: Throughout the Hebrew and Christian Bibles,

                    is described as a shepherd. Obviously, a shepherd is an archetype of a caregiver
                    or caretaker, but there are additional qualities of shepherds that the ancient
                    Hebrews may have had in mind when setting them apart as special: in ancient
                    times, to be a shepherd was to live simple life, without much in the way of
                    possessions; to be a wonderer, owning no land; and to be subject to elements,
                    relying on luck or, perhaps, the grace of God, rather than on agricultural
                    science and carefully reasoned planning. The way of life and the characteristics
                    of a shepherd would be seen as very different from those of a farmer.</note>

                    [sic] in Verse 17 of the last chapter, and it is not clear whether Cain is
                    cursed by the ground or whether Cain is more cursed than the ground. In this
                    case, the first alternative seems more reasonable since the blood literally
                    cries out from the ground. The present verse, then, might be an indication as to
                    how one could interpret Gen. 3:17." (Sacks 71)</note>

                <note target="#a059">Editors' Comment: This is perhaps the third instance of
                    personification in this story, and surely the strangest and most striking. Why
                    would the earth open its/her mouth to drink human blood? Whether we take it
                    literally or metaphorically, this vampiric behavior suggests an amoral or
                    possibly immoral quality to one of the most prominent features of the natural
                    world. Simultaneously, it seems to underscore a difference between the divine
                    and natural orders, a difference previously indicated by Yahweh favoring the
                    younger brother over the elder. This difference may be further emphasized if we
                    understand the murder of Abel as the kind of sacrifice that might be made to a
                    fertility god; the parallelism between the previous offerings and this action
                    seems to encourage that view. But clearly, Yahweh is not that type of fertility
                    god. Additionally, as Kass notes, the murder takes place not in a cultivated
                    field, but an uncultivated one: a wild, natural setting (Kass 141).</note>

                    the reader because, up to this point, there has been no reason to assume there
                    were more than four human beings total in the world. Unlike the reader, however,
                    Yahweh does not seem puzzled and takes seriously Cain's suggestion that someone
                    might murder him. Could Cain be thinking of his father or mother? Have other
                    people been created since Adam and Eve? Is the text simply unconcerned with that
                    time of plot-based realism? One thing we can be sure of is that Cain still
                    evinces no sign of remorse. Additionally, Yahweh's bestowing of the protective
                    mark parallels his act of clothing Adam and Eve before expelling them from the
                    garden.</note>

                    called Nod ("Wandering") and apparently continues in his ways. In the ancient

                    herding/wandering and farming/settled/city people. Possibly, the point is that
                    righteous descendants may eventually diverge from the misguided path of a
                    forefather. Alternatively, the way the use of the Hebrew word for cattle, with

                    unquestionably divine male beings, and the phrase suggests the translation 'sons

                    them 'angels,' which strikes me as a theologically driven cop-out. The Hebrew
                    language sometimes uses the phrase 'son(s) of' to mean persons or beings
                    belonging to the category of which they are 'sons.' A 'son of the East,' for
                    instance, a description of Job in his book, certainly means something like 'an

                    The particular care of man for man which political life requires precludes the
                    unity of all living beings characteristic of earlier times. The problem which

                    Comment: "The word that I have translated 'life force,' nepheš, is sometimes
                    translated 'soul,' but that is a confusion between Hebrew and Greek. Greek knows
                    of a 'soul,' a psychē, but it is a different principle entirely. In Genesis 2,
                    when the man is formed out of dust, and Yahweh breathes breath into his nose, he
                    becomes a 'living being,' as I translated it there: a nepheš chayyah, a somewhat
                    redundant way of saying a nepheš, really alive. That expression has
                    traditionally been translated “a living soul.” But it’s not like the Greek soul,
                    which was apparently in some respects thought to be indestructible. Part of what
                    is being commanded in 9.4 is not to eat living animals, and that was expanded at
                    some point to require that meat was edible under Jewish law only if the blood
                    had been drained out. That is part of what is meant even today by 'kosher'
                    meat." (Good 84-85)</note>

                    father or, alternately, penetrates him sexually. The latter possibility is
                    reinforced by the fact that 'to see the nakednes of' frequently means 'to

                    in an act of intercourse, or at least attempted intercourse. [. . .] One answer
                    suggests itself. Ham commits incest with his mother after his father is rendered
                    incapacitated by drink (and after Noah arouses the mother but proves incapable
                    of satisfying her). Ham supplants his father, much as the sons of God before

                    be superseded by the Covenant. [. . .] When Ham looked upon his father's
                    nakedness he implicitly rejected the New Way insofar as that Way was essentially

                    gods. Some were in favor of the Flood, and some were opposed. There were many
                    sides to be considered in determining what was just and what was unjust. Each
                    side could be heard because there were many gods present. Monotheism would
                    appear either as tyranny or as the assumption that there are no legitimate
                    problems on the highest level, that everything thoughtful men considered to be
                    problematic is ultimately mundane, since on the highest level only one side can
                    be defended or for that matter even stated. Again, some acknowledgment of pagan
                    insight is necessary. The unity of God in monotheism must be wide enough to
                    include all sides. To that extent a certain kind of manyness must still be
